Override CWnd::WndProc in CMainFrame to detect/interceot WM_COMMAND messages

- Change the CommandManager to handle the WM_COMMAND dispatch (using translate accelerator) AddContext() 
  now takes a window handle.
- Debug the accelerator change not working problem (write/find a common tracing mechanism)
- Modify the Interspy message filtering system to enable white listing (in addition to black listing)
